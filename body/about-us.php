            <p>
                Since our launch in 2022, We have been at the forefront of youth culture.
                From the proliferation of streetwear to its infiltration of luxury, we led the charge as traditional
                boundaries came down. Today we don't just talk about youth culture, we shape it.

            <p>
                We're drawn to the people, ideas, places, products, and brands shaping the lives of young people
                today,
                often before they’ve entered the mainstream. “Trend” is not a word we invest stock into. “Hype” is
                the
                antithesis of what we care about. The world we see is one through the prism of style.

                We believe in connection first, not Comscore.

                The rules around what we desire and why we desire it are being rewritten daily. Discover how you can
                re-write them with us.
